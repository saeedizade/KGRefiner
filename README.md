## section 1 : KGRefiner
Code will be coming soon. 
## section 2 : Datasets
Datasets are suitable to run on [OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE) framework. However, you can find triples in train2id, valid2id, and  test2id files. <br>
We made the FB15K237-Refined from FB15K237 and WN18RR-Refined from WN18RR by our KGRefiner.
